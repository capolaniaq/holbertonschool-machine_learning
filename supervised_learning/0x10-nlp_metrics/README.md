# 0x10. Natural Language Processing - Evaluation Metrics

## Author: Carlos Andres Polania (capolaniaq@correo.udistrital.edu.co)

-   What are the applications of natural language processing?
-   What is a BLEU score?
-   What is a ROUGE score?
-   What is perplexity?
-   When should you use one evaluation metric over another?
## Tasks

### 0. Unigram BLEU score
Write the function  `def uni_bleu(references, sentence):`  that calculates the unigram BLEU score for a sentence:

-   `references`  is a list of reference translations
    -   each reference translation is a list of the words in the translation
-   `sentence`  is a list containing the model proposed sentence
-   Returns: the unigram BLEU score

### 1. N-gram BLEU score

Write the function  `def ngram_bleu(references, sentence, n):`  that calculates the n-gram BLEU score for a sentence:

-   `references`  is a list of reference translations
    -   each reference translation is a list of the words in the translation
-   `sentence`  is a list containing the model proposed sentence
-   `n`  is the size of the n-gram to use for evaluation
-   Returns: the n-gram BLEU score

### 2. Cumulative N-gram BLEU score

Write the function  `def cumulative_bleu(references, sentence, n):`  that calculates the cumulative n-gram BLEU score for a sentence:

-   `references`  is a list of reference translations
    -   each reference translation is a list of the words in the translation
-   `sentence`  is a list containing the model proposed sentence
-   `n`  is the size of the largest n-gram to use for evaluation
-   All n-gram scores should be weighted evenly
-   Returns: the cumulative n-gram BLEU score
